What this project is going to try to accomplish:

The user registers a bunch of sound tracks, for example, video game soundtracks

The user hums a registered soundtrack

The computer tells the user which soundtrack the user might be humming, or a list of what the user is humming, or a sorted list of most relevant to least relevant, and plays each one.

## The twist? No using pip to install extra libraries.

Parts that are going to be really tricky:

Getting microphone input

Interpreting microphone input

Getting input from a sound file

(interpreting a sound file should be the same as a microphone input)
